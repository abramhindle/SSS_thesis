* Abram feedback:
    - You need a lot more prior work.
    - You need to explain a lot more.
    - You need to consider what people don't know.
    - The motivation needs to be more clear and verbose
    - Probably we have to evaluate the curated collection
    - You should talk about instruments you can make with this.
    - Can you cluster the results so we can get a soundfont of an instrument?
* To learn:
    - look up physical synthesis
* Genetic search on envelope only, then graph onto interactive plot

* Add prior work:
    - [x] Gather prior work
    - [ ] Write more  about prior work

* Write results of genetic search
    -[x] Change synth params
    -[x] Write evolution loop
    -[x] Write mutation functions
    -[ ] Measure time for stacks sizes 1-2-4
    -[ ] write results in paper

* Do bandit search
    -[x] Do week 1 of RL course
    -[ ] figure out what's next

* Test variation of models' score 
    -[x] Gather data
    -[ ] Find method of test
    -[ ] Write results

* Shrink data base? How many drums groups to use?

* Fix the latex warnings

* Make free drum database
    -[x] Make it
    -[ ] Host it

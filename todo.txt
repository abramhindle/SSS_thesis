* Abram feedback:
    - You need a lot more prior work.
    - You need to explain a lot more.
    - You need to consider what people don't know.
    - The motivation needs to be more clear and verbose
    - Probably we have to evaluate the curated collection
    - You should talk about instruments you can make with this.
    - Can you cluster the results so we can get a soundfont of an instrument?

    -[x] Write mutation functions
    -[ ] Measure time for stacks sizes 1-2-4

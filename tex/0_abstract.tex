Can we generate drum synthesizers automatically?\\
Recent advancements in digital synthesis, heuristic search, and neural networks can be utilized for sound generation; Yet the need for data, the problem of open set recognition, and high computational costs persist as barriers towards the expansion of sound libraries using these techniques.
We present a number of approaches taken towards the automatic generation of synthesizer programs which mimic one-shot percussive sounds. 
We focus on the implementation an automatic system for generation of quick and scalable percussion synthesizers using classical signal processing. Our system relies on virtual ears to automatically find and classify synthesizer programs that mimic percussive sounds.
We demonstrate promising results in both detection and categorization of percussive sounds by representation of digital audio through Fourier transformations and autoencoder embeddings.
Manual listening tests of the system's outputs demonstrated successful generation of drum synthesizers and categorize drum sounds using various approaches.
To facilitate future research, we share our curated dataset of free percussive sounds.
